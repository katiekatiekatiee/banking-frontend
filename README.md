# Savings Tracker and Calculator

Welcome to the Savings Tracker. Here, a user may add transactions (uncluding deductions) to a running list, appropriately named "transaction history." Each transaction is associated with a goal, or reason for saving the funds, which is able to be selected from a dropdown menu. Additionally, the total amount of funds based on the sum of all transactions is displayed and updated as the user files transactions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Usage

Use the links to navigate the application, keeping in mind the application will only be available while the backend server is also running. New transactions are saved to the database and availble on the list of transactions without refreshing the page. You will find that the total amount saved also updated without a page refresh. When adding a transaction, don't forget to select a goal or reason for adding/subtracting the funds.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Please also ensure the associated backend server is running simultaneously at http://localhost:3000.

Backend repository: https://github.com/katiekatiekatiee/banking-backend

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
