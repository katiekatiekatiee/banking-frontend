# Savings Tracker and Calculator

Welcome to the Savings Tracker. Here, a user may add transactions (uncluding deductions) to a running list, appropriately named "transaction history." Each transaction is associated with a goal, or reason for saving the funds, which is able to be selected from a dropdown menu. Additionally, the total amount of funds based on the sum of all transactions is displayed and updated as the user files transactions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Usage

Use the links to navigate the application, keeping in mind the application will only be available while the backend server is also running. New transactions are saved to the database and availble on the list of transactions without refreshing the page. You will find that the total amount saved also updated without a page refresh. When adding a transaction, don't forget to select a goal or reason for adding/subtracting the funds.
